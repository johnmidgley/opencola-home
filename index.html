        <h2>What is OpenCola?</h2>
        
        <p>
            OpenCola is:
            <ul>
                <li><b>A Company:</b> OpenCola is a non-profit company that producess free
                    and open source software for public benefit.
                </li>
                <li><b>A Set of Values:</b> We value transparency, accountability, personal control and security
                    and aim to maximize trust by maximizing these values. Futhermore,
                    we believe that these values are essential to individual freedom.
                </li>
                <li><b>A Toolkit:</b> OpenCola is a <a href="https://github.com/johnmidgley/opencola">toolkit</a> that
                    enables people to create trust networks. It is
                    designed to be an alternative to big tech that puts you in control of your personal data and
                    allows you to shape the flow of information around you. 
                </li>
                <li><b>An Application:</b> The first application we have built is a collaborative media tool
                    that allows you to save and share links as well as create organic
                    posts. It looks a lot like exisitng social media, but addresses the long list of
                    trust issues that current applications have created.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Overall, OpenCola is a reaction to the current state of the Internet, where a
            small number of companies has extracted,
            captured and exploited the value of our personal data and relationships. It
            represents a paradigm shift in how we think about the Internet, by inverting
            the current power structure, putting <i>you and your community</i> in control. We believe that this is more
            in line with the original vision of the Internet as an environment where everyone
            can participate and benefit equally.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Where do I get the application?</h2>
        <div class="install-icons">
            <a class="button-link" href="install/mac?auto">Mac OS</a>
            <a class="button-link" href="install/windows?auto">Windows</a>
            <a class="button-link" href="install/linux?auto">Linux</a>
        </div>
        <h2>Sounds great, but what does OpenCola actually do?</h2>
        
        <p>
            As mentioned above, the first application we built is a collaborative media tool
            that can be thought of as an alternative to big tech social media. The feed looks like:
            <img src="img/feed.png" width="100%">
        </p>
        
        
        
        <p>
            On top of providing you with similar features to existing social applications,
            OpenCola offers the following benefits:
        </p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>Local First Data</b>: You decide where your data lives, which by default is
                on your device. And you can collect data from existing sites and applications.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Personal Search</b>: Everything you and your peers post is available through
                search.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Personal Archive</b>: The things you save get archived so that you can
                access them later, even when offline.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Personas</b>: People express themselves differently depending on the
                audience. Existing social media generally ignores this distinction.
                OpenCola provides personas that allow you to express yourself in a more
                authentic fashion because you are in full control of the audience that
                you’re interacting with. You can share with and talk to your friends
                differently than you share with and talk to your family or your work
                colleagues. This means you aren’t forced to communicate to “the lowest
                common denominator” of people you’re connected to.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Trusted Connections</b>: With OpenCola, you don’t need to reveal that you exist
                to anyone, except the people you trust and want to interact with. You can
                connect with someone just by exchanging a token using Email, SMS, Chat, etc.
                This means that unless you allow it, there are no bots, scammers, trolls,
                ads, algorithms, or 3rd party intermediary manipulation. For those that want
                to be public, we will support a registration server at a later phase.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Information Centricity</b>: Existing social media is designed to maximize personal
                celebrity vs. engaging in shared conversation. If two people share the same
                web link or story, they may never know each other has shared it, and all
                activity accumulates separately. With OpenCola, activity around shared posts
                / links is aggregated, allowing for collaboration to grow around ideas.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Community Moderation</b>: Information only flows when you make the decision to
                save it, not because an algorithm thinks it will generate activity. You can
                also mark information as untrusted which can be used by your peers as a
                filter or as warning to help your peers navigate unknown information /
                sources.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>What do you mean by trust?</h2>
        <p>OpenCola is built to maximize trust in the following dimensions:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Transparency</b>: People need to see and understand the motives,
                intentions, and actions of others in order to trust them. This type of
                visibility is essential in empowering people to make informed decisions
                about how to interact with other people, companies or applications. With OpenCola, everything is
                transparent - the code, the people you interact with and where information comes from.
            </li>
            <li><b>Accountability</b>: People need to take responsibility for their actions and
                decisions in order to be trusted, which requires negative consequences for bad
                behavior. With OpenCola, those that abuse trust lose influence in the network and
                cannot regain influence without regaining trust.
            </li>
            <li><b>Personal Control</b>: People need control over how they interact with each
                other, how they use an application, and how information about them is used. With OpenCola, people have
                maximal control over their experience.
            </li>
            <li><b>Security</b>: People need assurances that a bad actor can’t pretend to be
                someone they aren’t or access information in an unauthorized manner. With OpenCola, cryptographic
                techniques are used to verify identity, ensure data integrity and keep information private.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Each of these principles is largely minimized by companies whose objective is to maximize profit. These
            trust principles also serve to enable freedom in a number of ways that are essential to a healthy society:
        </p>
        <ul>
            
            <li><b>Freedom of Identity</b>: People have complex identities and interact with different people in
                different ways. OpenCola lets you create personas that are connected to different groups of people,
                allowing you to be more authentic, avoiding the "lowest common denominator" behavior of other social
                applications.
            </li>
            <li><b>Freedom of Association</b>: With OpenCola, you can interact with whomever you like as well as exclude
                anyone that has violated your trust. And because there is no incentive to maximize engagment, you will
                never be suggested connections, which can lead to unintentionally connecting with malicious actors.
            </li>
            <li><b>Freedom from Manipulation</b>: Scammers, trolls and bots do not have a viable way to get into your
                network, so cannot influence you for their benefit. In addition, the algorithms that
                companies use to optimize for engagement for advertising are blind to the harms they
                cause through promoting unhealthy and untrustworthy content. OpenCola puts people, who can make
                appropriate value judgements, in control of what information gets shared.</li>
                <li><b>Freedom from Surveillance</b>: Only people you trust see what you share, minimizing the opportuntiy
                    for a 3rd party collect your information. </li>
                    <li><b>Freedom to walk away</b>: OpenCola was designed to have minimal switching costs. Since you are in
                        full control of you data, you can disconnect the network and still use the application or your data in
                        any way you want.</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <h2>So why should I trust OpenCola?</h2>
                    <p>
                        Fair question. We’ve all been burned too many times. Companies have been
                        telling us what trust is and that we should just trust them for a long
                        time.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        The above trust principles guide how we operate and what we build. That
                        is why we are a non-profit company, our code is open source that you are
                        free to modify to best fit your needs, and your data is not visible to
                        us. We can never extract the value of your networks or information and
                        exploit it for profit, nor can anybody else (unless that’s what you
                        want).
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        In order to make things easy to use, we provide some centralized
                        services, but we provide you the means to run everything on your own.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        OpenCola is also free, in the freedom sense - you can take what you
                        like, modify it, sell it, and we can never take it away. It will run as
                        long as your device operates.
                        
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        We believe that true competition requires competition of incentive
                        models. We reject the belief that obscene corporate profit equals
                        consumer good. We are guided by maximizing trust rather than
                        seeking metastasized growth to satisfy investors and shareholders.
                    </p>

                            your local device by default. You are essentially “always
                            migrated”, so there is no switching cost. You can use any

                            parties seeking to manipulate belief</a>. Information in the OpenCola network is traceable
                            so those spreading bad information can be held to account by being
                            cut off, resulting in a loss of influence. In addition, information
                            only flows when someone trusts it enough to save it for themself.
                            Lastly, information can also be marked as untrusted which helps
                            peers avoid it.

                    <h2>Who are you, and why are you building OpenCola?</h2>
                    <p>
                        We are people that are tired of the state of the Internet and would like
                        to help fix it, because it’s a problem worth solving, even if we don’t
                        make loads of money doing so. The founders of OpenCola all worked at the
                        <a href="https://en.everybodywiki.com/Opencola_(company)">original
                            OpenCola</a>, founded in 1999, which was building something similar in
                            spirit, but was unfortunately too far ahead of its time. We’ve all
                            gained a lot of experience and seen what the Internet has become and
                            would like to do what we can to steer it in the right direction.

                        <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
                        <h3>How do you stop bad people from using OpenCola?</h3>
                        <p>
                            We don’t. Anything we do to monitor or control activity requires
                            invading privacy and undermines our trust values. Every technology
                            has unintended consequences. The Internet enables bad things, but if
                            you’re reading this, then you’re using it, despite the fact that
                            people can do bad things with it, likely because you believe that it
                            brings more good than harm. Similarly, we believe that the world is
                            better with OpenCola than without it, even if people use it in ways
                            that we don’t support.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Does OpenCola address “Filter Bubbles”?</h3>
                        <p>
                            Yes and no. Since people, rather than algorithms, control the flow
                            of information, algorithmic filter bubbles are not an issue. But
                            people have their own biases and preferences, which can also lead to
                            filter bubbles as well as “echo chambers”. These are social, not
                            technical issues, that we believe cannot be fixed by forcing people
                            to consume information that they disagree with. Who or what would
                            even decide what people should see? Certainly not us. We believe
                            that the trust environment provided by OpenCola, which is less
                            polarized, is more likely to open minds than anything offered by ad
                            driven, for profit companies or any algorithmic / technological
                            solution.

                        <h3>How do you connect with people you don’t know?</h3>
                        <p>
                            Traditional social media has a loose trust model, which allows
                            people to connect with or follow other people with little or no
                            permission required. With OpenCola, because we’re focused on trusted
                            connections, currently both ends of a connection need to agree to
                            share information. As publishing is a useful activity, though, we
                            intend to support a publisher model, where you can create personas
                            that can be connected to by anyone.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            While technically simple, the question then becomes should we
                            support searching for publishers? This opens the door to
                            <a
                            href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/nov/11/twitter-blue-check-verification-impostor-accounts">
                            verification problems</a>, so we think publishers would need to
                            communicate their ids outside of OpenCola, like you do today when
                            sharing an email address or any other social media id. OpenCola
                            could then just host (cryptographically) verified details about
                            publishers, including where information posted by the publisher can
                            be retrieved.
